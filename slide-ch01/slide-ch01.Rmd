#  Learning Objectives 

+ Here are some of the concepts you will learn in this chapter.
	+ Define and distinguish the terms actions , movements , and neuromotor processes and give examples of each.
	+ Describe the one common motor skill characteristic for each of three motor skill classification systems, the two categories of skills in each system, and examples of skills in each category of each system.

#  The Study of Motor Skills: Motor Learning, Control, and Development 2 

+ Motor control involves the study of:
		+ How the neuromuscular system functions to activate and coordinate the muscles and limbs involved in the performance of a motor skill.
			+ While learning a new skill.
			+ While performing a well-learned skill.
	+ Motor development involves the study of:
+ Motor behavior and human development from infancy through old age.

#  Skills and Actions 



---
#  Characteristics of Skills and Actions 

+ There is a goal to achieve.
	+ Types of motor skills of interest are performed voluntarily.
	+ Motor skills require movement of joints and body segments to accomplish task goals.
	+ Skills need to be learned, or relearned.

#  Movements and Neuromotor Processes  



---
#  Why Distinguish Actions, Movements, and Neuromotor Processes 1 

+ Actions, movements, and neuromotor processes represent the order in which motor control & learning are prioritized.
	+ People initially learn to achieve action goals.
	+ People use a variety of movements to discover the best movement to accomplish the action goal.
	+ People modify neuromotor processes by refining the movement and making it more efficient.

#  Why Classify Motor Skills?

#  One-Dimension System: Size of Primary Musculature Required 

+ With the One-Dimension system, there are two categories.
		+ Gross motor skills : Require the use of large musculature to achieve the goal of the skill.
			+  Example: Walking, jumping, et cetera. 
		+ Fine motor skills : Require control of the small muscles to achieve the goal of the skill.
			+ Example: Skills involving hand-eye coordination.

#  One-Dimension System: Specificity of Where Movement of a Skill Begins and Ends 1 

+ Two main categories.
	+ Discrete motor skills : Specified beginning and end points, usually require a simple movement.
		+ Example: Flipping a light switch.
	+ Continuous motor skills : Arbitrary movement beginning and end points; usually involve repetitive movements.
		+ Example: Steering a car.

#  One-Dimension System: Specificity of Where Movement of a Skill Begins and Ends 2 

+ Combination category: Serial motor skills .
	+ Involve a continuous series of discrete movements.
		+ Example: Shifting gears in a stick shift car.
		+ Playing piano.

#  One-Dimension System: Stability of the Environmental Context 1 

+ Environmental context : The physical location / setting in which a skill is performed.
	+ Three specific features.
		+ Supporting surface.
		+ Objects involved.
		+ Other people or animals.

---
#  One-Dimension System: Stability of the Environmental Context 2 

+ Two main categories.
	+ Closed motor skills : Involve a stationary supporting surface, object, and/or other people/animal; performer determines when to begin the action.
		+ Example: Picking up a cup while seated at a table.
	+ Open motor skills : Performed in an environment in which supporting surfaces, objects, and/or other people or animals are in motion; environmental context in motion determines when to begin the action.
		+ Example: Catching a thrown ball.

#  Gentile’s Two-Dimensional Taxonomy 

+ Taxonomy : A classification system that is organized according to relationships among the component characteristics of whatever is being classified.
![](assets/img/image43.png)

---
#  Gentile’s Taxonomy of Tasks 1 

+ Environmental context.
	+ Regulatory conditions : Features of environmental context* to which movements must conform to achieve the action goal.
		+ They regulate spatial and temporal aspects of the movement as well as the forces that underlie these characteristics.
		+ *Objects, surfaces, or other people.
+ Nonregulatory conditions : Features of environment that have no influence or only an indirect influence on movement characteristics.

---
#  Gentile’s Taxonomy of Tasks 2 

+ Environmental context.
	+ Intertrial variability : Variations in the regulatory conditions associated with the performance of a skill change or stay the same from one trial to the next.
	+ Example: When someone walks through a room several times in which various objects are located in different places each time because each walk through requires the person to walk with different movements to avoid colliding with the objects.

#  Gentile’s Taxonomy of Tasks 

+ Function of the action.
	+ Body stability: Skills that involve no change in body location during the performance of the skill.
	+ Body transport: Includes active and passive changes of body locations.
	+ Object manipulation: Maintaining/changing the position of moveable objects.

#  Characteristics of Gentile’s Taxonomy 

+ Each skill category poses different demands on the performer.
	+ Skills that demand the least of the performer are the simplest; those that demand the most are the most complex.
		+ Skill categories begin at the top leftmost category with the simplest skills and progress to the most complex in the bottom rightmost category.
	+ Environmental context dimension and the action function dimension form the basis for creating sixteen categories of motor skills.

---
#  Practical Application of the Taxonomy 

+ Can be used for evaluating a learner’s movement capabilities and limitations.
	+ Becomes a valuable tool for systematically selecting a progression of functionally appropriate activities to:
		+ Increase person’s performance capabilities.
		+ Help the person overcome his or her performance deficiencies.
	+ Charts a person’ s progress.
		+ Creates a profile of competencies .
