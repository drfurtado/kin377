  abstract = {"This twelfth edition primarily updates the previous edition by adding more recent research and interpretations of the concepts and theoretical views associated with those concepts that were in the eleventh edition. Similar to the previous editions this new edition continues its two most distinctive features as an introductory motor learning and control textbook: its overall approach to the study of motor learning and control and the organization of the implementation of that approach. In every edition of this book, the overall approach has been the presentation of motor learning and control "concepts" to identify the common theme of each chapter. The concepts should be viewed as generalized statements and conclusions synthesized from collections of research findings. Following the concept statement is a description of a real-world application of the concept, which is then followed by discussions of specific topics and issues associated with the concept. An important part of these discussions are summaries of research evidence, on which we base our present knowledge of each topic and issue, as well as the implications of this knowledge for practitioners. The benefit of this organizational scheme is the presentation of motor learning and control as a set of principles and guidelines for practitioners, which are based on research evidence rather than on tradition or "how things have always been done"--},

Retention was measured after a 10-min or 10-day delay under blocked and random sequences of presentation. Subsequent transfer to a task of either the same complexity or greater complexity than the originally learned tasks was also investigated. Results showed that retention was greater following random acquisition than under changed contextual interference conditions. Likewise, transfer was greater for random acquisition groups than for blocked acquisition groups. This effect was most notable when transfer was measured for the transfer task of greatest complexity. Results are considered as support for W. F. Battig's (1978) conceptualization of contextual interference effects on retention and transfer. (13 ref)},

In this review, we show how modern technologies can support people in learning new motor skills. First, we introduce important concepts in motor control, motor learning and motor skill learning. We also give an overview about the rapid expansion of machine learning algorithms and sensor technologies for human motion analysis. The integration between motor learning principles, machine learning algorithms and recent sensor technologies has the potential to develop AI-guided assistance systems for motor skill training. We give our perspective on this integration of different fields to transition from motor learning research in laboratory settings to real world environments and real world motor tasks and propose a stepwise approach to facilitate this transition.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: There is little guidance on using extrinsic feedback to enhance motor learning after stroke. This narrative review synthesises research findings and identifies questions remaining to be answered. METHOD: A summary is given relating to the use of extrinsic feedback in healthy subjects. Then, research concerning content of feedback, feedback scheduling, and attentional focus is discussed in relation to patients with stroke. RESULTS: Though research is scarce, preliminary key findings were as follows: Patients' balance performance can improve from receiving visual feedback about weight distribution during practice; auditory feedback of force production may improve performance of sit-to-stand; providing feedback on less than 100\% of trials, and giving summary or average feedback may enhance learning; instructions or feedback inducing an external focus may be more effective than those with an internal focus. Further research is needed concerning the relative benefits of verbal, visual, video and kinematic feedback; reduced feedback frequencies and summary feedback schedules; feedback delays, error estimation, and self-controlled feedback; and attentional focus of feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are some indications that feedback might enhance motor learning after stroke, there are many areas as yet not examined and there is clearly a need for considerable research in this area.},

  abstract = {Attention and Motor Skill Learningexplores how a person's focus of attention affects motor performance and, in particular, the learning of motor skills. It synthesizes the knowledge coming from recent research examining the effects of attentional focus on motor performance and learning, and it provides practical implications for both instructional and rehabilitative settings.Attention and Motor Skill Learningchallenges traditional views that the method of learning a motor skill involves focusing attention on each part of the skill and internalizing proper execution. Instead, author Gabriele Wulf argues that the learning of new motor skills suffers when attentional focus is on the coordination of movements. When attention is directed to the desired movement effect, however, performance levels rise. Not only is a higher level of performance often achieved faster with an external rather than an internal attention focus, but the skill is retained better. The advantages of external focus apply to a variety of skills and skill levels and may be used while instructing athletes, children, and those with physical impairments as well as in any setting in which effective and efficient training of motor skills is a concern.Attention and Motor Skill Learningnot only presents the latest research on attentional focus, but it also offers practical solutions for bypassing or at least shortening the first “conscious” stage of learning. Instructors may then use these suggestions to provide their students or patients with a faster and more effective way to develop and perform motor skills. This text turns research into application by-detailing how a person's attentional focus changes with age and type of task and in later stages of learning, allowing readers to apply the information to a variety of ages and settings;-providing specific instructional examples and challenges in “Practical Applications” sections that may be used in everyday teaching scenarios; and-including comparison tables and offering suggestions for differentiating instructions regarding internal and external foci of attention.To help teachers understand how the wording of their instruction can facilitate the learning process, Attention and Motor Skill Learningshares insights from athletes, musicians, and speech therapists on their thinking as they perform or teach selected skills in each chapter's “Attentional Insights” section. The “Future Directions” sections at the end of each chapter highlight potential research studies that challenge readers to use and further develop the methods and practices in the book. Other useful features include case studies and chapter-opening scenarios that present motor-learning problems and demonstrate the role of attentional focus in solving them.Attention and Motor Skill Learningprovides many practical examples and implications for teaching, learning, relearning, and performing motor skills. This book will help readers better understand the effects that attentional focus has on motor performance and learning as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects. While challenging traditional learning methods, this book presents the latest research and demonstrates how changing one's focus of attention can speed the learning process and lead to more effective performance of motor skills.},

  abstract = {Feedback frequency effects on the learning of a complex motor skill, the production of slalom-type movements on a ski-simulator, were examined. In Experiment 1, a movement feature that characterizes expert performance was identified. Participants (N = 8) practiced the task for 6 days. Significant changes across practice were found for movement amplitude and relative force onset. Relative force onset is considered a measure of movement efficiency; relatively late force onsets characterize expert performance. In Experiment 2, different groups of participants (N = 27) were given concurrent feedback about force onset on either 100\% or 50\% of the practice trials; a control group was given no feedback. The following hypothesis was tested: Contrary to previous findings concerning relatively simple tasks, for the learning of a complex task such as the one used here, a high relative feedback frequency (100\%) is more beneficial for learning than a reduced feedback frequency (50\%). Participants practiced the task on 2 consecutive days and performed a retention test without feedback on Day 3. The 100\% feedback group demonstrated later relative force onsets than the control group in retention; the 50\% feedback group showed intermediate performance. The results provide support for the notion that high feedback frequencies are beneficial for the learning of complex motor skills, at least until a certain level of expertise is achieved. That finding suggests that there may be an interaction between task difficulty and feedback frequency similar to the interaction found in the summary-KR literature.},
