# Appendices A, B, C

## Introduction

-   Major Requirement: Perform a motor skill (Hand Juggling or Speed Cup Stacking).
-   Demonstrate mastery through video recording.
-   Write a reflection paper on the learning experience.
-   Option to switch skills in the initial weeks of practice.

## Hand Juggling: Overview

-   Requires practice and dedication.
-   Time to master depends on various factors.
-   Assignment allows up to 4 months for learning.
-   Emphasis on not delaying practice.

## Juggling Requirements

-   Juggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds.
-   Follow the "exchange continuous" technique.
-   Avoid incorrect techniques such as juggling with a pause or in a circling motion.

## Preparing for Juggling

-   Choose appropriate objects (avoid light objects like scarves or plastic bags).
-   Consider Motor Learning Principles for effective practice.
-   Practice few hours per day.

## Speed Cup Stacking: Overview

-   Required to perform the 3-6-3 technique.
-   Aim for completing the “up & down” under specific time limits for points.

## Preparing for Cup Stacking

-   Acquire a set of 12 professional cups.
-   Follow the provided tutorial for practice.
-   Practice a few hours per day.
-   Apply Motor Learning Principles effectively.

## Video Recording Guidelines

-   Record performance of the chosen skill.
-   Ensure good lighting and choose an appropriate recording device.
-   Record a sequence of three trials.

## Important Notes for Video Recording

-   Continuous recording without editing.
-   Record exactly three attempts.
-   Best attempt considered for grading.

## Video Submission Process

-   Record and submit video via Canvas.
-   Adhere to assignment-specific requirements.

## Learning Task Updates

-   Several updates required throughout the semester.
-   Update 1: Cognitive stage reflection.
-   Update 2: Video update.
-   Update 3: Principles of Motor Learning application.

## Reflection Paper Requirements

-   Describe the learning experience in 6 pages.
-   Discuss movement through Fitts and Posner's stages of learning.
-   Include 3 Motor Learning Principles.
-   Adhere to formatting and referencing guidelines.

# Appendix C

## Motor Learning Principles in Skill Acquisition

-   Purpose: Integral to the Learning Task Assignment in both practice and reflection.
-   Requirement: Select and discuss three MLPs from the list provided, alongside the “Stages of Learning” principle.
-   Focus: Application of MLPs to enhance understanding and mastery of a chosen motor skill.
-   Reflection: Incorporate MLPs in the reflection paper, detailing their role in progressing through learning stages.
-   Quizlet Resource: Study MLPs using the provided Quizlet set for better comprehension.

## Key MLPs for Practice and Reflection

1.  **Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off Principle**
    -   Balance between the speed of performance and accuracy demands.
2.  **Action-Effect Principle (Internal vs External Focus)**
    -   Planning and controlling actions by focusing on the intended outcome rather than movements themselves.
3.  **Encoding Specificity Principle**
    -   Memory performance improves with similarity between practice and test contexts.
4.  **Transfer of Learning Principle (Positive or Negative)**
    -   Influence of prior learning on acquiring new skills or applying skills in new contexts.
5.  **Augmented Feedback Principle (Concurrent, Terminal)**
    -   External information supplementing sensory feedback for performance enhancement.
6.  **Cognitive Mediation Theory**
    -   Benefit of observing skilled models and translating movements into cognitive codes for performance.
7.  **Practice Variability Principle (Random vs Blocked)**
    -   Impact of varying practice conditions on skill learning.
8.  **Distribution of Practice Principle (Distributed vs Massed)**
    -   Influence of rest intervals between practice sessions on learning.
9.  **Overlearning**
    -   Continued practice beyond achieving a specific performance criterion.
10. **Whole vs Part Practice Principle**

-   Choosing between practicing entire skill or in segments based on skill complexity and organization.

### Dr. Denny’s Application of MLPs in Coaching Volleyball

-   Focus: Application of MLPs for effective volleyball skill acquisition and coaching.
