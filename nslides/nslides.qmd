## Learning objecitves

1.  Define [overlearning]{.alert} in terms of how it relates to the decision about the amount of practice time needed to learn motor skills
2.  Describe how an overlearning practice strategy influences the learning of procedural skills and dynamic balance skills.
3.  Discuss the relationship between overlearning and other practice condition variables.
4.  Describe how the concept of practice distribution is related to the intertrial interval and to the length and distribution of practice sessions.
5.  Discuss evidence supporting the benefit for distributed practice of the distribution of practice sessions and possible reasons for this benefit.
6.  Compare and contrast massed and distributed intertrial interval schedules for discrete and continuous skills.
7.  Describe how to implement knowledge of massed and distributed practice in various skill learning situations.

## Introduction

-   **Is more practice better?**
    -   The “more practice is better” approach is not always beneficial for learning.
-   **Before scheduling practice sessions, what are the three things that one needs to decide?**
    -   the amount of time to devote to each activity in a session
    -   the length of each session, and
    -   the amount of resting time between sessions

-   **What is Overlearning?**
    -   Continuation of practice beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion. Is there empirical evidence for the benefits of overlearning?
-   **Is there empirical evidence for the benefits of overlearning?**
    -   Overlearning can positively influence the retention of motor skill learning.
-   **The instructor must:**
    -   Establish a performance criterion; 20 kicks under 30s
    -   Wall Soccer Test Provide the learner time to achieve it;
    -   If they achieve the goal in 10 trials (average time of several students), then you could…
    -   Devote a percentage of that time as extra practice (10 more trials) extra practice (100%)

## This is a subtitle

Here we have some text that may run over several lines of the slide frame, depending on how long it is.

-   first item
    -   A sub item

Next, we'll brief review some theme-specific components.

-   Note that *all* of the standard Reveal.js [features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) can be used with this theme, even if we don't highlight them here.

## Additional theme classes

### Some extra things you can do with the clean theme

Special classes for emphasis

-   `.alert` class for default emphasis, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
-   `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
-   `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

Cross-references

-   `.button` class provides a Beamer-like button, e.g. [[Summary](#sec-summary)]{.button}

### See our longer demo slides

We've deliberarely kept this template lean, to get you up and running as fast as possible.

We provide a separate [demo template](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo), with more examples for integrating code, tables, figures, etc.

-   See the live demo slides [here](https://grantmcdermott.com/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo/template.html).

## Summary {#sec-summary}

### A minimal and elegant presentation theme

The Quarto reveal.js clean theme aims to be a minimal and elegant presention theme.

Install the theme.

``` bash
quarto install extension grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

Use this lean template.

``` bash
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

Use the longer demo template.

``` bash
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo
```
