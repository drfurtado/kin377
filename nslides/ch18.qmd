## Learning Objectives

-   Define the terms \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as they relate to the relationships among the parts or components of a complex motor skill.
-   Describe ways to apply the part-practice methods of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the practice of motor skills.
-   Describe several ways to apply \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ methods to the practice of motor skills.

## Definitions

-   **Whole practice**
    -   A practice strategy that involves practicing a skill \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (i.e., as a whole)
-   **Part practice**
    -   A practice strategy that involves practicing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of a skill before practicing the whole skill

## Practice a Skill as a Whole or in Parts

The decision to practice a skill as a whole or in parts can be based on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ characteristics of the skill. Hypothesis by Naylor and Briggs, 1963.

-   **Complexity:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of parts or components and the degree of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that characterize a skill.
    -   More complex tasks have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ component parts and place more demands on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    -   Note: "Complexity" is distinct from "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
-   **Organization:** The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ among the component parts of the skill.
    -   Skill has a high level of organization when its component parts are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ interdependent.
        -   Example: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    -   Low level of organization: When the component parts are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ independent.
        -   Example: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## Decisions to Use Whole or Part Practice

Assessing the levels of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of a skill.

-   If the skill is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, practice the whole skill.
-   If the skill is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, practice by using the part method.

See a closer look: The simplification method for learning three-ball juggling in the next slide.

## How to decide whether to use Whole or Part practice?

-   One needs to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the skill
-   According to Naylor and Briggs (1963), focus on:
    -   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
    -   the extent to which the spatial-temporal characteristics are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
    -   decide which levels of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ best represent the skill

## Organization vs. Complexity approach: beam routine in gymnastics

|                     | Low Organization     | High Organization    |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Low Complexity**  |                      | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| **High Complexity** | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |                      |

[Organization]{.alert}: The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ among the component parts of the skill.

[Complexity]{.alert}: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of parts or components and the degree of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that characterize a skill.

Rule of thumb

-   If High in Organization --\> one [must]{.alert} use \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because the parts are interconnected; else, either approach is ok.
-   If High in Complexity --\> one [must]{.alert} use \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because the parts are interconnected; else, either approach is ok.

## Part practice: Fractionization

-   Definition: Fractionization is a part-practice strategy for skills requiring \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (AC).
    -   What is AC?
        -   Tasks that demand \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ movements from each limb (arm or hand) simultaneously.
-   Does it matter which limb to practice first?
    -   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of individual limb movements determines the order of practice.
        -   Sherwood (1994) suggests starting with the more \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ limb.
-   Controversy in Research
    -   Mixed evidence on the efficacy of whole versus part-practice approaches.
    -   Fractionization is supported as an effective strategy for asymmetric skills (Walter & Swinnen, 1994).

## **Examples**

Musical instruments like the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or sports skills like the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## Segmentation - Intro

-   Method
    -   Start with practicing the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, then progressively integrate additional parts, culminating in the whole skill.
    -   The progression should ideally move from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, optimizing learning outcomes.
-   Overcoming Integration Challenges
    -   Problem: Difficulty arises when trying to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ separate parts of a skill learned in isolation.
    -   Solution: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ part practice reinforces the connection between parts as the learner advances.

## Segmentation - Advantages

-   Allows \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on individual parts, easing the cognitive load.
-   Mitigates difficulties in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ learned parts into a whole skill.
-   Ideal for skills involving \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of movements.
-   Facilitates \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ coordination as parts are integrated.
-   Combines the attentional benefits of part practice with the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ advantages of whole practice.
-   The learner progressively masters the coordination of parts while managing the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the whole skill.

## Segmentation - Examples

-   The breaststroke
    -   It can be divided into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    -   Each part is learned separately before integrating them, focusing on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ timing.
-   Empirical Support for Segmentation
    -   Watters (1992): Demonstrated benefits for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on a keyboard.
    -   Ash and Holding (1990): Showed advantages for learning a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## Simplification - Intro

-   Definition: Simplification involves \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ a skill or its components to make it easier to perform.
-   Aimed at helping learners grasp \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ skills by reducing difficulty.
-   Strategies: Several methods can be used, each tailored to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ types of skills.

## 1. Reducing Object Difficulty

-   Technique: Use \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ objects to reduce task complexity.
-   Example: Learning to juggle with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ instead of balls to slow the movement.
-   Research Support: Early practice with simpler objects aids in grasping the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Hautala, 1988).

## 2. Reducing Attention Demands

-   Strategy: Minimize the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by reducing the complexity of the task.
-   Example: Using \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ while learning to slalom improves focus on movement coordination (Wulf et al., 1998; Wulf & Toole, 1999).
-   Application: Body-weight support systems in gait rehabilitation reduce the cognitive load of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Miller, Quinn, & Seddon, 2002).

## 3. Reducing Speed

-   Purpose: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ practice to emphasize the timing and spatial aspects of a skill.
-   Benefit: Establishes essential \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ patterns that can be transferred to normal speeds.
-   Evidence: Effective for learning both \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Walter & Swinnen, 1992).

## 4. Adding Auditory Cues

-   Method: Incorporate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ signals to guide the performance of skills.
-   Success: Assists in improving gait in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ patients (Thaut et al., 1996).
-   Broader Application: Auditory cues aid various \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and enhance motor rehabilitation (Rochester et al., 2009; White et al., 2009; Malcolm, Massie, & Thaut, 2009).

## 5. Sequencing Skill Progressions

-   Approach: Gradually \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the complexity of tasks in a sequenced manner.
-   Example: Baseball players progressing from hitting off a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to hitting a pitched ball.
-   Research: Shows benefits for learning \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and increased \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Hebert, Landin, & Solmon, 2000; Stevens et al., 2012).

## 6. Simulators and Virtual Reality

-   Advantages: Allows practice without \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ consequences and offers control over specific conditions.
-   Examples: Diverse applications across \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ training.
-   Effectiveness: Generally supported by research when similar to the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ environment (Fisher et al., 2002; Howells et al., 2008).

# Other Approaches

## An Attention Approach to Part Practice in Whole Practice

-   Premise: It's possible to focus on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of a skill during whole practice to improve specific aspects.
-   Advantage: Merges the benefits of both \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ practice strategies for skill development.

**Theoretical Support for the Attention Approach**

-   Attention Theory: Kahneman's model highlights '\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_' as a key to allocating attention.
-   Application: Directing attention to a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ part of a skill during its performance.

## Empirical Evidence of Attention-Directing Strategy

-   Study: Gopher, Weil, and Siegel (1989) on learning the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
-   Findings: Directing attention to specific \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the game improved mastery.

**Implementation of Attention-Directing Strategy**

-   Instructions focused on specific skill components, e.g., \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the spaceship or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mines.
-   The dual-strategy group (controlling spaceship first, then handling mines) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ other groups.

## Teaching Implications

-   Before deciding whether to practice a skill as a whole or by parts, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the skill to identify its component parts.
-   After analyzing a skill and identifying its parts, determine the degree to which the performance of any one part \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on the performance of the preceding part. When parts are characterized with this relationship, the parts should be practiced \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ rather than as separate parts.
-   It is important not to assume that because parts can be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, they should be practiced separately; the performance dependence on preceding and following parts should always \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the decision concerning which parts to practice separately and which parts to practice together.
-   When the parts of a skill follow a specific \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of movements, the preferred way to engage in part practice is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ part method, in which parts are practiced in sequence and become increasingly larger until the whole skill can be practiced in its entirety.
-   When practicing the parts of a skill is not advisable or possible, consider ways to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the whole skill before engaging people in performing the skill as it would be performed in its real-world context.
-   When the technology is available, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ provide excellent initial means of engaging people in practicing a skill before having them practice it as it would be performed in its real-world context.
-   Directing attention to a part of a skill while performing the whole skill can be an effective way to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ errors for parts of a skill that should not be practiced as separate parts.
