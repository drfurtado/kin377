## Objective

This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of the Cognitive Stage of learning described by Fitts and Posner - cited in [@magill2021] . You are required to critically analyze your own learning experiences in relation to this model.

## Instructions

### Initial Post (Due by Thursday)

You are to submit an initial post that reflects on your personal learning experiences in the context of Fitts and Posner's Cognitive Stage of skill acquisition. In your reflection:

-   **Describe:** Provide a detailed account of a specific learning experience (e.g., acquiring a new skill or mastering a concept). Ensure you describe the initial challenges, the strategies you employed, and the progression of your understanding or skill level.

-   **Analyze:** Compare and contrast your experience with the characteristics and implications of the Cognitive Stage as outlined by Fitts and Posner. Are there elements of your experience that align with their theory? Are there discrepancies? Why might these exist?

-   **Cite:** Support your analysis with direct references to our textbook, Magill & Anderson (insert the correct year of publication where YYYY is indicated). Please ensure your citation follows the appropriate academic format.

Your post should critically engage with the theory, using your experience as a lens.

-   **Compare:** How does your experience align or differ from that of your peer?
