## Purpose

This assignment is designed to deepen students' understanding of motor learning principles by applying theoretical concepts to practical skills development in juggling or speed cup stacking. By selecting and analyzing two specific learning principles, students will reflect on their progress through the Fitts & Posner Stages of Learning, articulate the challenges they've encountered, and critically assess the effectiveness of these principles in enhancing their motor skills. The task encourages not only theoretical application but also critical thinking, peer interaction, and academic writing proficiency, fostering a comprehensive learning experience that bridges classroom knowledge with real-world skill application.

## Requirements

-   Read the content of [Appendix C](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin377/syllabus-fo.html#sec-appendix-c) found in the syllabus.

## Instructions

As part of the final assessment before submitting your end-of-semester video performance, complete the following tasks:

1.  **Select Principles:**

-   Choose two principles from Appendix C that you have applied in learning either juggling or speed cup stacking.

2.  **Detailed Analysis:** For each selected principle, provide:

-   **Principle Identification and Definition:** State the name and provide a definition from our textbook, including proper APA citation.
-   **Application to Learning Stages:** Describe how this principle has guided your progression through the Fitts & Posner Stages of Learning. Include specific actions, decisions, or methods employed at each stage (cognitive, associative, autonomous) and their impact on your skill development.
-   **Challenges Encountered:** Discuss any difficulties you faced while applying the principle and how you addressed these challenges. Specify how these hurdles affected your learning process.

## Submission Guidelines

-   **Format:** Submit your analysis as a discussion post on Canvas. Do not attach files; instead, copy and paste your text directly into the Canvas text box.
-   **Length and Deadlines:**
-   **First Response:** Approximately 350 words due by THURSDAY 11:59 PM. Respond to the initial assignment post.
-   **Second Response:** Three replies, approximately 150 words each, due by SUNDAY 11:59 PM. Respond to posts from your classmates.

**Notes:**

-   You must post your first response before you can view replies from others.
-   Ensure all textbook citations are correctly formatted in APA style as discussed in Week 1. This includes in-text citations and a reference list.
