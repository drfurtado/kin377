## **Objective**

To deepen your understanding of the motor learning process through firsthand experience by practicing a simple motor skill and analyzing your performance across successive trials.

## **Materials Needed**

-   A penny or a small flat object
-   A target with a bullseye and concentric outer layers, delineating different scoring zones
-   Graphing paper or access to digital graphing software

## **Instructions**

1.  **Introdoouction**

    -   Familiarize yourself with the principles of motor learning and the performance curves that illustrate the stages of skill acquisition.

2.  **Task Explanation and Demonstration**

    -   Understand the task at hand: You are required to flick a penny towards a target with the goal of landing it as close to the bullseye as possible.
    -   Pay attention to the demonstration of the proper technique for flicking the penny to achieve higher scores.

3.  **Practice Session**

    -   Engage in a practice session that includes 30 trials, divided into six blocks, each containing 5 trials.
        -   Take a 1-minute break after 15 trials (end of Block 3)
    -   Within each block of 5 trials, maintain a consistent approach to get a fair representation of your skill acquisition.

4.  **Data Collection**

    -   Your partner will Record your score after each trial, based on the zone where your penny lands on the target.
        -   A trial is to be repeated if the coin does not leave its assigned area (circle)
    -   At the end of each block of 5 trials, calculate the average score for that block to track your performance.

5.  **Data Analysis**

    -   Following the practice session, plot a graph representing your performance curve using the average scores from each block of trials.
    -   Your graph will help you visualize your learning progression over time.

6.  **Discussion and Reflection**

    -   Prepare to participate in a class discussion where you will share your graphs and observations.
    -   Reflect on your experiences and try to identify the stages of motor learning as evidenced in your performance curves.

#### **Note**

-   Throughout this activity, your goal is not just to enhance your skill but also to grasp a deeper understanding of the motor learning process by analyzing your performance evolution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This activity encourages you to engage actively in understanding the intricate process of motor learning, through both practice and analytical observation. As you proceed with the task, strive to connect the theoretical knowledge imparted in the lectures with your practical experiences to foster a rich comprehension of motor skill acquisition.
